# Contributing to Exercism.io

First of all, **thank you** for helping with Exercism.io!

## Issues 
Please file issues on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/kytrinyx/exercism.io/issues) and give as much detail as possible.

## Features / Pull Requests

If you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a pull request that implements it. Tests and docs would be wonderful.

There are full instructions on getting the app running [in the README](https://github.com/kytrinyx/exercism.io/blob/master/README.md).

Please try and stick to the [Ruby Style Guidelines](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) with the one exception of using Jim Weirich's style of [braces vs do-end](http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/BraceVsDoEnd.rdoc).

Thank you again!
