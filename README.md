## Contact Us

To report a bug, suggest improvements to exercism.io, or if you're having trouble
installing or using the CLI, please **[open a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues)**.

You can also visit our [support chat](https://gitter.im/exercism/support). We're just
getting started with this, so activity is quite low, but the more people chat there, the
more people will hang out.

If you're having trouble writing the code for an exercise on exercism.io, then
your best bet might be [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Remember to search
first, before posting, and remember that you're asking about the _programming language_
problem, not the _exercism_ problem.

Another option is to submit the code even though it doesn't pass the tests yet, and then
go to your submission page to explain where you're stuck.

We welcome questions, and will do our best to help you out!

Follow us on Twitter [@exercism_io](https://twitter.com/exercism_io).

Jump in and chat with other exercism enthusiasts on the #exercism channel on irc.freenode.net.
It's not a very active channel, but we're a friendly bunch.
