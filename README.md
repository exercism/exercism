# Welcome to Exercism

This is the central point of contact for Exercism.

## Where to open issues

The project is divided across many repositories.

#### The website or product
If you have any issues or questions regarding **the website (https://exercism.io)** please [open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues). To report errors in the website copy or submit fixes for typos or other improvements, please see the [exercism/website-copy](https://github.com/exercism/website-copy/issues) repository.

#### Version 3 (v3) of Exercism

We have a separate monorepo for the V3 content at [exercism/v3](https://github.com/exercism/v3) - we would **love** your help there. The v3 website is in development at [exercism/v3-website](https://github.com/exercism/v3-website). We are not accepting contributions to the website at this time.

#### The Command-Line Client (CLI)
For problems with the **Command-Line Client (CLI)**, open an issue in [exercism/cli](https://github.com/exercism/cli/issues).

#### Exercises in a particular programming language
The exercises are all in separate, language-specific repositories. These repositories are tagged with the topic [`#exercism-track`](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aexercism-track+org%3Aexercism&type=Repositories). From there, search for the track (programming language) you are participating in.

**Unsure? Open your issue here**

If you aren't sure where to open it, then pick this repository. It's as good a starting point as any!
