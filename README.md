Programming is hard. With practice it gets easier.

Exercism gives you hundreds of practice problems in over 30 programming languages,
and a place where you can get feedback on your solutions.

Exercism is especially well-suited for three types of practice:

- gaining fluency in your first programming language
- ramping up in a new programming language
- developing the skills to be a great lead developer: code review, refactoring, and mentoring

## Using Exercism

The process happens in two places.

0. Solve exercises in your local development environment.
0. Discuss solutions on the [Exercism website](http://exercism.io).

Once you submit the solution to an exercise you can:

- **learn by listening**: receive feedback on your code.
- **learn by reading code**: browse all the other solutions to exercises you submitted solutions to.
- **learn by sharing your experience**: provide feedback on other people's code.

Even in the most trivial exercise, there are many important things to discuss. Simplicity, naming,
readability, idioms, good use of existing libraries, performance, and much, much more.

Get started using exercism on the [exercism.io website](http://exercism.io).

## Getting Help

### Are you stuck trying to solve an exercise?

Submit the unfinished solution and
describe in a comment on the website what you tried, and where you're stuck.

Or jump into the [support chat](https://gitter.im/exercism/support), and we'll
try to help you out.

### Did you find a bug?

That's always frustrating. Go ahead and [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues),
and we'll help figure out what's going on.

## Contributing to Exercism

There are many ways to contribute to Exercism, and only a few of them involve writing code.

Use our guide to help you find the right spot to start:

### Setting up your development environment

If you want to work on a language track, you don't need to run the exercism.io website locally. Just clone down the [repository of the language you're interested](http://exercism.io/repositories#language-tracks-you-can-contribute-to) and follow the instructions in the README and Contributing Guide there.

If you want to work on the Exercism website, check out the installation instructions in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repository.

## What's Going On at Exercism?

We send out a weekly "behind the scenes" update about new language tracks, bugs that crop up, features that people are working on, and other Exercism-related tidbits. You can [sign up for the newsletter here](https://tinyletter.com/exercism).

## Thank you

Exercism.io is free and open source, and many, many people have contributed to the project. This is a project that started by accident and could never have gotten off the ground by the efforts of any single person.

**Thank you!** :heart:
