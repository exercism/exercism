Exercism is a place where programmers help each other level up their coding skills.

There are practice exercises in 30 programming languages. Solve an exercise
and submit it to the website where you can discuss trade-offs and improvements with
other programmers. Then refactor and submit a new iteration.

We're a friendly bunch, and we're happy to help you help us, so don't be scared to ask about anything.
We've got a chat room and there are usually people around there, or just ask right in the issue you're wondering about.

There is a whole repo made just to hold curated "todo" issues.
Start looking at the issues labeled "start here":
https://github.com/exercism/todo/labels/start-here
and then if you find an issue that seems interesting, follow the links from there.

If you're into Go, check out the repository for the CLI.
We've labeled a few issues with "good first issue": https://github.com/exercism/cli/labels/good-first-issue
The bugs are, of course, up for grabs as well!

Lastly, in this repository, there's a bunch of stuff, mostly un-curated.
Here your best bet is going to be to poke around (see: https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/labels/bug), and ask some questions.
Consider it triage (which is sorely needed and much appreciated!).

Also check out the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This is a project that started by accident and could never have gotten off the
ground by the efforts of any single person.

**Thank you!**
