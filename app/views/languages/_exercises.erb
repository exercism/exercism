    When you're logged in, you can say <code>exercism fetch <%= track.id %></code> to get
    the next available exercise on the track.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every time you submit a solution to an exercise, you will get the next in line the next time
    you fetch.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to try a specific exercise, you can always fetch it directly (commands
    are listed below).
  </p>

  <p>
    The exercises are ordered roughly in order of difficulty, but it's a bit haphazard.
