  When you're logged in, you can say <code>exercism fetch <%= track.id %></code> to get
  the next available exercise on the track.
</p>

<p>
  Every time you submit a solution to an exercise, you will get the next in line the next time
  you fetch.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to try a specific exercise, you can always fetch it directly (commands
  are listed below).
</p>

<p>
  The exercises are ordered roughly in order of difficulty, but it's a bit haphazard.

<h3>Available Exercises</h3>
<ul class="available_exercises_listing">
  <% track.problems.each do |problem| %>
    <li>
    <a href="/exercises/<%= track.id %>/<%= problem.slug %>"><%= problem.name %></a>
    <span class="tagline"><%= problem.blurb %></span>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
