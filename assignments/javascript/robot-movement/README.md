# Robot Movements

The robot factory manufactures robots that have three possible movements:

* turn right
* turn left
* advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical, infinite grid, facing a particular
direction (north, east, south, west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates, e.g.
`[3,8]`.

Write a program which allows a robot to move on the grid.
