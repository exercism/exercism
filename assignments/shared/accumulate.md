For example, given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.
