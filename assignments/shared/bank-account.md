A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make deposits and
withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops can charge against the
account.

Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes
(terminology depends on your programming language).

The account only needs to be available when the bank is open, though it may be
available at all times. You will get notified when the bank opens and closes.

## Instructions

Run the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the first
test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make that pass as
well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to submit.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a
solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.

Have fun!
