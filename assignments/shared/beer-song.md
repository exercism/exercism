Note that not all verses are identical.

The verse for 1 bottle is as follows:

```plain
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
```

The verse for 0 bottles is as follows:

```plain
No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
```

You can get multiple verses by passing in the verse to start from, and (optionally) the last verse to include.


## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these are some additional things you could try:

* Remove as much duplication as you possibly can.
* Optimize for readability, even if it means introducing duplication.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?
