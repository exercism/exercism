The input is first normalized: The spaces and punctuation are removed from the
English text and the message is downcased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.
These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle
when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

> If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots

is 54 characters long.

Broken into 8-character columns, it yields 7 rows.

Those 7 rows produce this rectangle when printed one per line:

```plain
ifmanwas
meanttos
tayonthe
groundgo
dwouldha
vegivenu
sroots
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.

For example, the message above is coded as:

```plain
imtgd vsfea rwerm ayoog
oanou uiont nnlvt wttdd
esaoh ghnss eoau
```

Write a program that, given an English text, outputs the encoded version of
that text.

The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the length of the message.

If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25,
36, etc), use that number of columns.

If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of columns
that corresponds to the smallest square that is larger than the number of
characters in the message.

For example, a message 4 characters long should use a 2 x 2 square. A message
that is 81 characters long would use a square that is 9 colums wide.

A message between 5 and 8 characters long should use a rectangle 3 characters wide.

Output the encoded text in groups of five letters.

For example:

- "Have a nice day. Feed the dog & chill out!"
  - Normalizes to: "haveanicedayfeedthedogchillout"
  - Which has length: 36
  - And splits into 5 6-character rows:
    - "havean"
    - "iceday"
    - "feedth"
    - "edogch"
    - "illout"
  - Which yields a ciphertext beginning: "hifei acedl vâ€¦"
