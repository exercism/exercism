In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.
  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc.,
  and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe. Grade 3â€¦"

Note that all our students only have one name.
(It's a small town, what do you want?)


## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these are some additional things you could try:

* If your implementation allows outside code to mutate the school's internal DB directly, see if you can prevent this. Feel free to introduce additional tests.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?
