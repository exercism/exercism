When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it gets a new name.


## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these are some additional things you could try:

* Random names means a risk of collisions. Make sure the same name is never used twice. Feel free to introduce additional tests.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?
