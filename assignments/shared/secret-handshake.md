> There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

```
handshake = SecretHandshake.new 9
handshake.commands # => ["wink","jump"]

handshake = SecretHandshake.new "11001"
handshake.commands # => ["jump","wink"]
```

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid binary as the value 0.
