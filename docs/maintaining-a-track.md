## Philosophy

### Be Kind

First and foremost, strive always to be kind, humble and show gratitude for the work being contributed.

**_Kind_ is not the same thing as _nice_.** Being kind does not mean being a pushover.
Doing the right thing is not always the thing that pleases the most people.

### Be Responsive

Even if you do not have an answer immediately, respond quickly. This lets the person on the other end know that they've been heard. If it takes a long time to figure out what to do, be honest about what's going on.

When responding to someone, `@`-mention them. This will ensure that they'll get a notification, even if they're not watching the issue or pull request.

### Empower New Contributors

As a maintainer, your most important task is to make it as easy as possible for people to successfully contribute. The exact details will vary, but often this means things like:

- documenting or scripting the necessary steps to get started with the codebase
- helping people understand how to use the tools successfully (including git and GitHub)
- writing detailed issues about work that needs to be done so that someone without knowledge of the project can easily find something to work on
- improving the tooling to reduce friction
- answering questions
- reviewing pull requests

### Recognize Contributions

Don't just merge a PR—thank contributors for their contributions.

Any contribution that helps is great, it doesn't have to be a great contribution. Let contributors know that you really value their work, no matter how small the contribution is.

If someone does great work consistently over time, invite them to become maintainers.

### Praise in Public, Reprimand in Private

If there is a contributor or commenter that is not behaving as we would like then it should be handled outside of GitHub if possible.

### Improve the Learning Experience

The exercises often start out as an experiment. As people do the exercises we learn a lot about what's interesting, tough, boring, challenging, fun, tricky, confusing, or useful.

Over time we try to:

- improve the problem descriptions in [exercism/x-common](github.com/exercism/x-common)
- add missing edge cases in the test suites
- reorder tests to allow a more incremental approach to solving the problem
- improve the test suites to avoid pushing people towards specific solutions
- reorder exercises to provide a gentler learning curve on the site
- deprecate exercises that don't provide enough value

### Collaborate

Maintaining a track is so much more fun and interesting when there are several people actively involved in the process.

Even with full push access, **create pull requests**. This notifies the other maintainers about the change.
As a general rule, ensure a fellow maintainer reviews your pull request, unless it is utterly trivial.

## Day-to-Day Tactics

### Watch Key Repositories

This will notify you of all new issues, pull requests, and comments.

In addition to the language track repository itself, you may also want to watch:

- the [exercism/x-common](http://github.com/exercism/x-common) repository which contains all of the exercise descriptions and metadata. Many discussions about improvements to the exercises happen here.
- the [exercism/discussions](http://github.com/exercism/discussions) repository where a lot of high-level discussions about Exercism itself happen (roadmap, direction, ideas, conundrums).

### Perform Common Tasks

- Triage issues [TODO: link to documentation]
- [Review pull requests](/docs/reviewing-a-pull-request.md)
