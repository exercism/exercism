/* Define custom server-side HTTP routes for lineman's development server
 *   These might be as simple as stubbing a little JSON to
 *   facilitate development of code that interacts with an HTTP service
 *   (presumably, mirroring one that will be reachable in a live environment).
 *
 * It's important to remember that any custom endpoints defined here
 *   will only be available in development, as lineman only builds
 *   static assets, it can't run server-side code.
 *
 * This file can be very useful for rapid prototyping or even organically
 *   defining a spec based on the needs of the client code that emerge.
