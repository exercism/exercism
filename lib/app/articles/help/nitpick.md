## How to Nitpick

**A practical guide to providing better feedback on solutions to exercises.**

When reviewing exercism submissions, it is possible and encouraged to share advice and insight on the style and approach of a given implementation.

Nitpicks should provide positive and constructive criticism, subtly nudging a coder toward progressively better implementations of an exercise.

Consider it an opportunity to explore the subtleties of a particular coding problem.

Instead of outright suggesting an altogether different implementation, consider instead giving suggestions of small adjustments or refactorings to evolve the design and style of the existing code toward a more ideal implementation, by some definition of ideal.

In most cases, our idea of ideal code is simple, readable, maintainable, and modular.

Consider it an opportunity to discuss different coding practices and the value they provide in the context of crafting better software.

Please note that _good job_ or _great work_ are not positive, constructive feedback. If there is something you like about a solution, be specific when describing it.

When leaving nitpicks, please remember that beginners do not always have the same confidence level as more experienced developers. It is therefore important to be courteous and considerate. Strive to be clear in your explanations and give users a chance to arrive at their own improvements. Might the Socratic Method be a suitable approach?
