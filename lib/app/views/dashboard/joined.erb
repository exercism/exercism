      <h2>Start a conversation with your code</h2>

          <p>Software development is an activity that should not be performed in isolation.  Exercism is intended to help you interact with other developers by way of your software code.</p>
          <p>Exercism provides a launching point for this to occur.  Here's how it works:<br />
          <ul>
              <li>You fetch some challenges in the form of README documents.  These include associated test suites</li>
              <li>Then write code in order to make the tests pass</li>
              <li>Submit the code and begin the conversation with others</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          
          <p>By repeating this process you will:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Share while discussing how YOU solved the problem</li>
            <li>Learn from others as you discover how they solved the same problem</li>
            <li>Gain experience through repeated practice solving problems</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          
      <h3>Don't be shy - start right now</h3>

        <p>Begin by installing the <code>exercism</code> CLI (<em>Command-Line Interface</em>) tool.  <a href="http://cli.exercism.io/" title="Installing the Exercism CLI">Details here</a></p>

<p>With the CLI installed, configure it using the <code>login</code> command. It will interactively ask for your API key, which is listed below. You can always find your API key on your <a href="/account">account page</a>.

<pre><code>
        $ exercism login
        Your GitHub username: <%= current_user.username %>
        Your exercism.io API key: <%= current_user.key %>
        What is your exercism exercises project path?    Press Enter to select the default (/path/to/current/dir):
</code></pre>

  <p>Fetch problems with this simple command:<br />
