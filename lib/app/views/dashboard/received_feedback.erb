        <h2>Having Conversations</h2>

        <p>There's no One True Solution<sup>TM</sup> to any of the problems (and don't believe anyone if they suggest there is). When others comment, remember that this is a conversation, not instruction. They probably don't have all the answers, and neither do you.</p>

        <p>Push back (politely) if you disagree with some feedback you get. It will make the conversation richer and more valuable to everyone to explore the reasoning and histories behind the preferences we all have.</p>

        <h2>Iterate!</h2>

        <p>There's no finish line, so feel free to take as many twisty turns as you like, experimenting with different approaches.</p>

        <h2>Done?</h2>

        <p>There's no rule for when you're done. You're done when you feel done. That might be that you're sick of the problem, or that you just don't feel like talking about it anymore, or that it's been hashed and rehashed, and there really isn't anything left to say about it. Or any other reason that you can think of.</p>

        <p>When you're ready to move on, click <em>OK, I'm done</em>, and you'll get access to all the other conversations that are happening on the same exercise.</p>
