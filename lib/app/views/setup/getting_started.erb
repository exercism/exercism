<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Start a trail</h4>
<p>Pick one or more of the available languages.</p>

<%= erb :"setup/unstarted_trails" %>

<h4>Step 2: Install the gem</h4>
<pre>
  $ gem install exercism
</pre>

<h4>Step 3: Configure the Gem</h4>
<p>Your credentials get saved in a config file in your home directory: <kbd>.exercism</kbd>.</p>
<pre>
  $ exercism login
</pre>

<p>You will be asked for your username, your API key, and the location on your filesystem that you'd like to put the exercises. The gem will suggest your current location as the default (in parentheses). If you are happy with that, you can simply hit enter to select that option.</p>

<p>Your api key is: <b><%= current_user.key %></b></p>

<p>You can always find your API key in <a href="/#{current_user.username}">your account</a>.</p>

<p>If you mess up your login, you can either edit the config file at
<kbd>~/.exercism</kbd> or <kbd>~/.config/exercism</kbd>
or you can say <kbd>exercism logout</kbd> and then try again.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Get the code</h4>
<pre>
  $ cd projects/exercises # or whatever
  $ exercism fetch
</pre>

<h4>Step 5: Submit the assignment</h4>
<pre>
  $ exercism submit path/to/your/code.ext
</pre>

<h4>Step 6: Discuss!</h4>
<p> Log in to exercism.io to discuss your code.</p>

<p>Discuss, resubmit, etc, until your code has been thoroughly bikeshedded. Then one of the admins will unlock the next assignment for you, and two things happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can fetch and submit the next assignment.</li>
  <li>You get to see all the pending submissions on the assignment you just completed, and nitpick the code.</li>
</ol>
