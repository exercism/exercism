        <p>Exercism provides a space to have thoughtful conversations about code. Explore simplicity, idiomatic language features, and expressive readable code.</p>

        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Practice writing expressive code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice accepting feedback graciously.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice giving feedback respectfully.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conversations</h2>
        <p>The code is a conversation starter. The interesting part begins when you begin having discussions with your peers about the nuances that you see. What do you like? What do they dislike? What are the trade-offs? How can the code be improved?</p>
        <p>Curious about what this might look like? <a href="/conversations/1">See this conversation</a> that happened on the Ruby track.</p>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>Contributing to open source can be very intimidating. It's scary to put your code in front of strangers. It's terrifying to be presented with problems that you probably don't understand, and don't know how to trouble-shoot.</p>

        <p>Exercism is still a prototype, and we're still experimenting with the basic feature set. The goal is to develop a V1 of the product from scratch using everything that we've learned building and using the prototype.</p>
        <p>The V1 will be built using well-known frameworks and conventions to make the barrier to contributing as low as possible.</p>

        <p>
          In November 2006 I joined the Cattle Drive on the JavaRanch. In short, you send in a assignment by email, and a real person gives you comments
          back. It didn't take long until I was nitpicking other people's code, and I have been doing so on a daily basis since then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviewing other people's code has taught me more about writing readable code, than receiving feedback on my own code. I wondered if it would be possible to have
          people first get nitpicked, then turn around and nitpick new people, and spread the effort of giving feedback across a larger group.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2013 I joined Jumpstart Lab as a developer and co-instructor for their 6-month full-time developer training program. One of the things we implemented
          was a daily programming warm-up exercise. At first, this was simply a README, then we added a test suite to help guide the students and let them get a taste of what TDD feels like. After a few months we had a number of pain points that we wanted to address:
        </p>
        <p>We had to manually upload a new warmup every morning</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>The students often did not finish exercises</li>
          <li>The students didn't get feedback on the code they wrote</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I decided to try to combine these ideas into an app, and launched a very rough prototype to the students in late June 2013.</p>
        <p>
          It came as a complete surprise to me that the project hit a nerve with people. I expected dozens of people to use the site. Within the first couple of months, over 1,000 people had submitted over 10,000 pieces of code.
