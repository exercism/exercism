    <h3>The Process</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Submit your code.</li>
      <li>Receive feedback.</li>
      <li>Resubmit your code. Rinse. Repeat.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once you feel like the discussion has wound down, click the "ok, I'm done" button, and the exercise will no longer appear in the lists of exercises for others to nitpick.</p>

    <p>As soon as you submit code to an assignment, <kbd>exercism fetch</kbd> will give you the next exercise so you have something to work on while you're waiting for feedback.</p>

    <p>You can always submit new versions of completed exercises. This will reopen the exercise for feedback.</p>

    <h3>Nitpick Others</h3>

    <p>When you've completed the first exercise, you will gain access to the exercises that are awaiting feedback.</p>
