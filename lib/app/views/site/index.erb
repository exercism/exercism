            <p class="home-p-text">
              Browse through the various <a href="https://github.com/exercism/x-api/tree/master/problems">language tracks</a>, or the code for <a href="https://github.com/exercism/cli">the CLI</a>. If you have a strong stomach, check out the code for <a href="https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io">this prototype</a>.

              For a quick-and-dirty overview of which languages and problems are available, we've got a <a href="http://synopsis.exercism.io/">synopsis</a>. You'll notice that some languages have more exercises than others. If you'd like to help remedy that, or if you'd like to contribute exercises in a new language, check out the <a href="https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guide</a>.

              If you're not into the whole code review thing and just want to work through small programming problems, then you don't need the CLI. Just clone the <a href="https://github.com/exercism/x-api/tree/master/problems">language track</a> that you're interested in and work through the problems locally.</p>
