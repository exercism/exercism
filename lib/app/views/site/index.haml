          Have a thoughtful discussion with your peers about the choices that you made. Take this opportunity to explore idioms, style, and trade-offs.  There's no right answer, and many good questions.

        %p Thousands of conversations are happening on exercism. <a href="/conversations/1">Here's one of them.</a>
        %p You start with some code.  Talk about it a little.  Rewrite the code a bit, then post the new version.  Make it better.  Rinse and repeat a few times. After a few cycles you've got improved code, and perhaps even a new friend!
