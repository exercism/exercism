### Thank you!

Thank you for trying out exercism.io, especially with all the chaos of _the early days_.

It came as a complete surprise to me that the project hit a nerve with people. I expected **dozens** of people to use the site. It's been 2 months since I showed the first couple of people, and since then 900 people have submitted over 8000 pieces of code.

It's exciting, and also a little scary. I hope that I can keep up, and that I don't disappoint you.

#### Experiment & Prototype

I still don't quite know what exercism.io will end up being. It helps that so many people are thinking out loud, sharing ideas, submitting bugs and feature requests and pull requests.

Not knowing where it is going means that everything could change. I will do my best to make that change as painless as possible, and will provide ample warning (and a data download) if things should change so drastically that you wouldn't be able to find early discussions.

#### Bottleneck

At the moment, things have been pretty backed up, and I imagine that it can get a bit frustrating waiting to move to the next assignment. I'm trying to bring in more help, and will also experiment with other ways of having people move forward without waiting for some moderator to unlock assignments.

#### Thoughts?

I would love to hear from you if you have ideas, or just want to share your thoughts about how things could be made better. What works, what doesn't, what would you hate to see change?
