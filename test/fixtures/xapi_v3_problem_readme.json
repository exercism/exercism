Open a\nterminal window and run the following command to install minitest:\n\n gem install minitest\n\nIf you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in\nthe test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running\nthe test file.\n\nIn order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise\ndirectory. For example, if the test suite is called\n`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:\n\n ruby hello_world_test.rb\n\nTo include color from the command line:\n\n ruby -rminitest/pride hello_world_test.rb\n\nThe test files may have the execution bit set so you may also be able to\nrun it like this:\n\n ./hello_world_test.rb\n\n\n## Source\n\nJ Dalbey's Programming Practice problems [view source](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/103/Projects/ProgrammingPractice.html)\n", "blurb":"Write a program that detects saddle points in a matrix."}}
