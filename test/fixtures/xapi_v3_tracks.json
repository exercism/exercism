C language track requires that you have the following software installed\non your system:\n\n* A modern C compiler\n* The Make build tool\n\nMicrosoft's Visual Studio IDE and Apple's Xcode IDEs combine the compiler and\nthe native build system into a single IDE (integrated development\nenvironment). Linux environments typically expose the compiler and native\nbuild system as separate command-line tools.\n\n\n#### Linux\n\nLinux users will need gcc or clang for the compiler, and `make` will be needed\nfor the native build. Make is pre-installed on most unix systems, but is most\nlikely available via your package manager. On Debian and Ubuntu based\ndistributions it can be installed with `sudo apt-get install make` if not\npresent.\n\n\n#### MacOS\n\nMacOS users can install gcc or clangwith [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) via\n`brew install gcc` or `brew install llvm`.\n\n\n#### Windows\n\nWindows users can get [Visual Studio Community 2013][vs-1013], a free download\nthat will give you the Visual Studio 2013 IDE and the latest version of the\nMicrosoft Visual C compiler.\n\n[vs-1013]: http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs\n\n","tests":"Each exercise supplies the unit tests and a Make build recipe.  You\nprovide the implementation.\n\nEach test file is meant to link against your implementation to provide a\nconsole executable that runs the tests.  Running the test executable\nprints messages for each failing test and reports a non-zero exit status\nwhen tests fail.\n\nWorking through each exercise is a process of:\n* Creating the initial build with Make\n* For each unit test:\n * Satisfy compile errors to make the test fail.\n * Implement just enough to make the test pass.\n * Refactor your implementation to enhance readability, reduce duplication,\n   etc.\n * Uncomment the next test\n\n\n### Compiling and running the tests\n\nEach exercise will bring a `makefile` file along with the unit\ntests in the `tests/` directory.  You should not need to edit the Make file.\nThe provided recipe assumes that your implementation exists as a header file\nand a source file named after the exercise.\n\nFor instance, the exercise `bob` expects an implementation in `src/bob.h`\nand `src/bob.c`.  For exercises with dashes in their name, the source\nfiles are assumed to use underscores, so `word-count` expects\n`src/word_count.h` and `src/word_count.c`.  You may decide that your\nimpementation is sufficiently simple that it can live entirely in the\nheader, in which case you can omit the `cpp` file.\n\n**Create your initial implementation files before running Make.**  If\nyou do not have files `src/bob.h` and `src/bob.c` when running\nMake for exercise `bob`, then Make will generate an error about files\nnot being found.  **These files can be empty, but they must exist.**\n\nYou can build your code using the appropriate command for your environment:\n\n* Linux with make: `make`\n* Windows with Visual Studio 2013: Select Build / Build Solution from the menu.\n* MacOS with Xcode: Select Build from the toolbar\n\n\n#### Testing on Linux or MacOS with make\n\nAssuming the current exercise is `bob` and we're in the exercise folder:\n\n```\n$ touch src/bob.{h,cpp}\n$ make test\n```\n\n\n#### Testing on Windows with Visual Studio 2013\n\n?\n\n\n#### Testing on MacOS with Xcode\n\n?\n","learning":"","resources":""},"problems":[{"slug":"anagram","name":"Anagram","blurb":"Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct sublist."},{"slug":"leap","name":"Leap","blurb":"Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year."},{"slug":"hamming","name":"Hamming","blurb":"Write a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands."},{"slug":"raindrops","name":"Raindrops","blurb":"Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's prime factors."},{"slug":"bob","name":"Bob","blurb":"Bob is a lackadaisical teenager.

A comparison chart of\n[C++ compiler support](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support)\nand related [discussion](http://en.cppreference.com/w/Talk:cpp/compiler_support)\nshows that most of the major features of C++11 are available on all major\nplatforms.\n\n#### Linux\n\nLinux users will need gcc 4.8 or later or clang 3.4 or later for the compiler\nand `make` will be needed for the native build.  Make is pre-installed on most\nunix systems, but is available via `sudo apt-get install make` if not present.\nGcc 4.8 supports C++11 with the `-std=c++11` argument and can be installed and\nset as the default compiler with the following recipe:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\n$ sudo apt-get -qq -d update\n$ sudo apt-get -qq install g++-4.8\n$ # make g++ 4.8 the default g++ executable\n$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 90\n```\n\n#### MacOS\n\nMacOS users can install gcc 4.8 with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) via\n`brew install gcc`.\n\n#### Windows\n\nWindows users can get\n[Visual Studio Community 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs),\na free download that will give you the Visual Studio 2013 IDE and the\nlatest version of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.\n\n### Prerequisite: CMake\n\nCMake is an open source cross-platform build system that generates build\nscripts for your native build system (`make`, Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.).\nExercism's C++ track uses CMake to give you a ready-made build that:\n* compiles the tests\n* compiles your solution\n* links the test executable\n* automatically runs the tests as part of every build\n* fails the build if the any tests fail\n\nUsing CMake allows exercism to provide a cross-platform build script that\ncan generate project files for integrated development environments like\nVisual Studio and Xcode.  This allows you to focus on the problem and\nnot worry about setting up a build for each exercise.\n\nGetting a portable build isn't easy and requires access to many kinds of\nsystems.  If you encounter any problems with the supplied CMake recipe,\nplease [report the issue](https://github.com/exercism/xcpp/issues) so we can\nimprove the CMake support.\n\n[CMake 2.8.11 or later](http://www.cmake.org/) is required to use the provided build recipe.\n\n### Prerequisite: Boost\n\nThe unit tests use Boost.Test, the unit testing framework included with\n[Boost](http://www.boost.org/index.html).  You may find other libraries\nin Boost useful to you as you work through the exercises.  In particular,\ngcc 4.8 does not have a proper implementation of the standard regular\nexpression library, but you can find a compatible library in Boost.\nYou will need to download and install Boost.  As of this writing Boost\n1.55 is the current version.  You will need a compiled version of the\nboost libraries Boost.Test, Boost.DateTime and Boost.Regex, or you will\nneed to download from source and build the library yourself.\n\nIf you are having difficulties installing Boost for use with exercism,\n[ask for help](https://github.com/exercism/xcpp/issues).\n\n#### Linux\n\nLinux users can get pre-built packages with the following recipe:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:boost-latest/ppa\n$ sudo apt-get -qq -d update\n$ sudo apt-get -qq install libboost1.55-all-dev\n```\n\nNote: These prepackaged Linux binaries are not compiled with gcc 4.8 and\nsome libraries may have issues as a result.  If a pre-built package is\nunavailable for your linux distribution, try\n[installing Boost from source](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html).\n\n#### Windows\n\nWindows users can download compiled binaries from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.55.0-build2/).\nYou must download the version appropriate for your compiler.  For recent\nversions of Visual Studio, the direct links are provided below:\n\n| Compiler | Download |\n|----------|----------|\n| Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop (32-bit) | [boost_1_55_0-msvc-12.0-32.exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.55.0-build2/boost_1_55_0-msvc-12.0-32.exe/download) |\n| Visual Studio 2013 (32-bit) | [boost_1_55_0-msvc-12.0-32.exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.55.0-build2/boost_1_55_0-msvc-12.0-32.exe/download) |\n| Visual Studio 2012 (32-bit) | [boost_1_55_0-msvc-11.0-32.exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.55.0-build2/boost_1_55_0-msvc-11.0-32.exe/download) |\n| Visual Studio 2010 (32-bit) | [boost_1_55_0-msvc-10.0-32.exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.55.0-build2/boost_1_55_0-msvc-10.0-32.exe/download) |\n\nIn this table, 32-bit refers to the kind of code generated by your\ncompiler and not the operating system.  Code compiled for 32-bit will run\non both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.  Code compiled for 64-bit\nwill only run on 64-bit versions of Windows.  The CMake recipes used in\nexercism create 32-bit projects for Visual Studio, so download the\nappropriate 32-bit version of Boost.\n\nOnce you download the compiled binaries, install them into a suitable\nlocation.  The installed location will contain a libraries directory\nnamed similarly to the install executable, such as `lib32-msvc-12.0`.\nRename this directory to `lib` so that CMake can find the precompiled\nlibraries.  If you don't rename the directory you will see an error\nlike this when you run CMake:\n\n```\n> cmake -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR:PATH=D:/tmp/boost_1_55_0 ..\n-- Building for: Visual Studio 12\n-- The CXX compiler identification is MSVC 18.0.30723.0\n-- Check for working CXX compiler using: Visual Studio 12\n-- Check for working CXX compiler using: Visual Studio 12 -- works\n-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info\n-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done\nCMake Error at C:/Program Files (x86)/CMake 2.8/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1106 (message):\n  Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.\n\n  Boost version: 1.55.0\n\n  Boost include path: D:/tmp/boost_1_55_0\n\n  The following Boost libraries could not be found:\n\n          boost_unit_test_framework\n          boost_date_time\n          boost_regex\n\n  No Boost libraries were found.

You\nprovide the implementation.\nEach test file is meant to link against your implementation to provide a\nconsole executable that runs the tests.  Running the test executable\nprints messages for each failing test and reports a non-zero exit status\nwhen tests fail.\n\nWorking through each exercise is a process of:\n* Creating the initial build with CMake\n* For each unit test:\n * Satisfy compile errors to make the test fail.\n * Implement just enough to make the test pass.\n * Refactor your implementation to enhance readability, reduce duplication, etc.\n * Uncomment the next test\n\n### Creating the Initial Build with CMake\n\nEach exercise will bring a `CMakeLists.txt` file along with the unit\ntests.  It contains the canned CMake recipe to handle the build for you.\nYou should not need to edit this file.  The provided recipe assumes that\nyour implementation exists as a header file and a source file named after\nthe exercise.\n\nFor instance, the exercise `bob` expects an implementation in `bob.h`\nand `bob.cpp`.  For exercises with dashes in their name, the source\nfiles are assumed to use underscores, so `word-count` expects\n`word_count.h` and `word_count.cpp`.  You may decide that your\nimpementation is sufficiently simple that it can live entirely in the\nheader, in which case you can omit the `cpp` file.\n\n**Create your initial implementation files before running CMake.**  If\nyou do not have files `bob.h` and `bob.cpp` when running\nCMake for exercise `bob`, then CMake will generate an error about files\nnot being found.  **These files can be empty, but they must exist.**\n\nUsing this recipe, CMake can generate a suitable project for your environment\nby running `cmake -G` with a suitable generator and the location of the\ndirectory for the exercise.  CMake will generate a build script appropriate\nfor your operating system.  To keep those generated files separate from\nyour exercise source code, it is common to create a directory called `build`\nto hold these generated build files, as well as the compiled code.  This\nwill keep your exercise folder uncluttered and tidy.\n\nSince you will be running CMake to create the build instructions for each\nassignment, you might want to create a bash script (Linux/MacOS) or\nbatch file (Windows) for this command.\n\nOnce the build environment has been created by CMake, you can build your\ncode using the appropriate command for your environment:\n* Linux with make: `make`\n* Windows with Visual Studio 2013: Select Build / Build Solution from the menu.\n* MacOS with Xcode: Select Build from the toolbar\n\nExamples of running CMake for different environments are shown below.\n\n#### Linux with Make\n\nThe generator name for CMake is `Unix Makefiles`.\nAssuming the current exercise is `bob` and we're in the exercise folder:\n\n```\n$ touch bob.{h,cpp}\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" ..\n```\n\nThis example shows creating empty files for the implementation before\nrunning CMake.\n\n#### Windows with Visual Studio 2013\n\nThe generator name for CMake is `Visual Studio 12`.  The same generator\nsupports all editions of Visual Studio 2013: Express, Professional,\nUltimate, etc.\nAssuming the current exercise is `bob` and we're in the exercise folder:\n\n```\n> copy nul: bob.h\n> copy nul: bob.cpp\n> mkdir build\n> cd build\n> cmake -G \"Visual Studio 12\" ..\n```\n\nThis example shows creating empty files for the implementation before\nrunning CMake.\n\nOn Linux and MacOS boost packages install the headers and libraries to\na standard global location on the system.  On Windows, you unpack the\nbinaries wherever you like or build from source wherever you like and\nthere is no standard install location on the system.\n\nIf you get complaints from CMake about not being able to find Boost, you\nneed to supply additional arguments to tell CMake where to find it by\nsetting the `BOOST_INCLUDEDIR` variable on the command-line.  Here is an\nexample using the Visual Studio 2013 generator:\n\n```\n> cmake -G \"Visual Studio 12\" -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR:PATH=D:/Code/boost/boost_1_55_0 ..\n```\n\n**Note:** Path locations passed to CMake always use slash (`/`) as the\ndirectory separator, even on Windows.\n\n#### MacOS with Xcode\n\nThe generator name for CMake is `Xcode`.\nAssuming the current exercise is `bob` and we're in the exercise folder:\n\n```\n$ touch bob.{h,cpp}\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake -G Xcode ..\n```\n\nThis example shows creating empty files for the implementation before\nrunning CMake.\n\n#### MacOS with Make\n\nThe generator name for CMake is `Unix Makefiles`.\nAssuming the current exercise is `bob` and we're in the exercise folder:\n\n```\n$ touch bob.{h,cpp}\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" ..\n```\n\nThis example shows creating empty files for the implementation before\nrunning CMake.\n\n## Boost.Test Documentation\n\nThe Boost.Test documentation is being rewritten to improve usability\nand is nearly complete.\nPrefer the documentation rewrite to look up something if you're unfamiliar\nwith Boost.Test and want to know more.\n* [Boost.Test documentation rewrite](http://user.xmission.com/~legalize/boost.test/)\n* [Boost.Test 1.55 official documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html)\n","learning":"## Learning C++ From Ground Zero\n\nC++ is a language with a broad, expressive syntax that supports several\ndifferent programming styles: procedural, object-oriented, functional,\nand generic as well as combinations of all of those together in the same\nprogram.  This language track attempts to introduce problems in\ngradually increasing difficulty.  However, elements of the language\nsyntax are best introduced in a form other than as a series of exercises.\n\nIn general, exercism assumes you already know the syntax and mechanisms\nof a language in a particular track.  However, knowing the syntax of a\nlanguage is merely the first step in gaining expertise in a language.\nExercism allows you to practice solving problems and share discussion\nwith other programmers who have solved the same problem.  It is from\nthe shared discussion that we gain expertise and insight into becoming\nbetter programmers.\n\nIf you are brand new to the C++ language, you should spend time learning\nthe basics of the language first.  Here are a few resources that can\nhelp you get started:\n\n* [Learn C++](http://www.learncpp.com/)\n* [C++ Koans](https://github.com/torbjoernk/CppKoans)\n\n[Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/) is a simple web form\ninterface to a C++ compiler that will let you try out small programs.\nSometimes this can be an easier way to perform a quick experiment than\nbuilding something locally in an integrated development environment.\n\n## Test-Driven Development in C++\n\nExercism assumes that you are familiar with the concept of test-driven\ndevelopment.  Each exercise comes with a series of tests that are already\nwritten for you.  You progress through the exercise one test at a time,\nwriting an implementation incrementally to satisfy the tests.\n\nIf you are new to test-driven development, it is strongly recommended\nthat you first work through the [Test-Driven Development in C++](https://github.com/boostcon/cppnow_presentations_2014/tree/master/files/test_driven)\nworkshop from [C++ Now! 2014](http://cppnow.org/).  The same tools used\nin that workshop are used in the C++ language track on exercism.\n","resources":""},"problems":[{"slug":"bob","name":"Bob","blurb":"Bob is a lackadaisical teenager.

is a modern, object oriented language which is developed and maintained by Microsoft.\n\nThe syntax of C# is very similar to other languages like Java and C++.\n\nC# is a reasonably popular language, in 2014 it was surveyed that 5% of developers used it.  The learning curve is small, reduced even if the developer has experience with other 'C-Style' languages.\n\nKey Benefits:\n\n- It has a great library with lots of well-documented, easy to use functionality such as writing to a text file, or accessing Windows related features.\n- Type Safety\n  - Type Safety is a language-agnostic compilation feature that means when code is compiled, types are validated.  This means for example a `string` value could not be assigned to an `int`.\n- Native Garbage Collection\n  - Garbage Collection (GC) is a feature that allows memory management.  When a resource like a variable, is no longer used, GC will release the related resources back to the system.\n","installation":"## Installing C&#35;\n\n### Windows\nThere are a couple of different ways to get started using C#. The main way is to\ninstall Visual Studio, the IDE for C# and related projects.\n\nIf you don't want to use the IDE, files can be compiled via command line using the\ncompiler provided by the .NET framework.\n\n#### With Visual Studio\n\nInstall [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop). This will include the IDE and compiler for C#.\n\nYou can either start by creating your own project for working with the Exercism problems or you can download a Visual Studio solution that is already set up.\n\n#### Exercism.io Visual Studio Template\n\nThis is a Visual Studio template that comes pre-configured to work on the problems in as many languages as Visual Studio supports.\n\n![Solution Explorer](/img/setup/visualstudio/SolutionExplorer.png)\n\n1. Download the [Exercism.io Visual Studio Template](https://github.com/rprouse/Exercism.VisualStudio) from GitHub by clicking the Download Zip button on the page.\n2. Unzip the template into your exercises directory, for example `C:\\src\\exercises`\n2. Install the [Exercism CLI](http://help.exercism.io/installing-the-cli.html)\n3. Open a command prompt to your exercise directory\n4. Add your API key to exercism `exercism configure --key=YOUR_API_KEY`\n5. Configure your source directory in exercism `exercism configure --dir=C:\\src\\exercises`\n6. [Fetch your first exercise](http://help.exercism.io/fetching-exercises.html) `exercism fetch csharp`\n7. Open the Exercism solution in Visual Studio\n8. Expand the Exercism.csharp project\n9. Click on **Show All Files** in Solution Explorer (See below)\n10. The exercise you just fetched will appear greyed out. Right click on the folder and **Include In Project**\n11. Get coding...\n\n![Add files](/img/setup/visualstudio/AddFiles.png)\n\nThe NUnit NuGet package is included in the project, so you will not need to install it.\n\nIf you have a paid version of Visual Studio install the [NUnit Visual Studio Test Adapter](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d). This will allow you to run the tests from within Visual Studio. If you have ReSharper installed, you can also [run the tests using ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/unit_testing.html).\n\n![Test Explorer](/img/setup/visualstudio/TestExplorer.png)\n\nIf you are using Visual Studio Express, install [NUnit 2.6.3](http://www.nunit.org/) and run the tests from the command line (see below).\n\n#### Create a New Visual Studio Project\n\nOnce installed and started, click on \"Create New Project\" (alternatively, you can go to File->New->New Project).\n\n![New Project](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/newProject.png)\n\nChoose what language and project type (Visual C# and Class Library). Also name your project to whatever you'd like.\n\n![Create Project](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/createNewProject.png)\n\nOnce created, feel free to drag and drop the C# Exercism folders into the project.\n\n![Drag and Drop Folders](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/dragDropFolders.png)\n\nIn order to compile, get the [NUnit](http://nunit.org/) assembly referenced for the unit tests. This can be done via [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) - a package manager for Visual Studio. The best packages is to get the base [NUnit]() and the [NUnit.Runners](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Runners/)\npackage since it includes the assemblies needed and a GUI test runner.\n\n![Nuget](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/nugetMenu.png)\n\nTwo options to use Nuget - the NuGet manager or through the Package Manager Console.\n\nThe manager is the easiest way to get started.\n\n![Nuget Manager](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/nugetManageNunitRunner.png)\n\nThe project should now be able to compile.\n\nTo start implementing the exercise, in Visual Studio, right click on where you want the file to go to and go to `Add` -> `Class`. Name it what you'd like.\n\n![New Item](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/addNewClass.png)\n\nNow you can start coding!\n\n#### With the command line compiler\nThe .cs files can also be compiled without Visual Studio. Get the latest version of\n[.NET installed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5a4x27ek(v=vs.110).aspx) and there will be an executable called csc.exe.\n\nThe compiler executable is usually located in the Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\Version folder under the Windows directory.\n\nRefer to this [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/78f4aasd.aspx) for more information on the command line compiler.\n\n### Mac\n\nInstall [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/download).\n\nWhile Xamarin is most known for creating iOS and Android applications, it's still a perfect IDE to create C# console\nor library projects which is all that's needed for Exercism.\n\nOnce installed and running, click on new solution and you'll find the C# library project to select.\n\n![Xamarin New Project](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/xamarin-csharp.jpg)\n\n### Linux\n\n[Mono Develop](http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_For_Linux_Developers) is available for Linux.\n","tests":"### Windows\nAll tests have been ignored except the first one for you to work on. To continue, just remove the ```[Ignore]``` attribute on the test to start working on it.\n\nMake sure [NUnit](http://nunit.org/?p=download) is installed, if not already installed from the setup from above.\n\nThis installation should include the NUnit-Gui executable. Run this and, after compiling, open the assembly from the Gui and you are able to run the tests.\n\n**Note:** You may need to include the nunit-framework.dll in the same directory as the source code you're compiling if you get an error saying it can't find the ```nunit.framework.dll```.\n\nIf you installed the NUnit runner through NuGet, the runner will be located in the ```\\packages\\NUnit.Runners(version number)\\tools``` folder where your project is.\n\nIf you installed NUnit manually the runner will be in the ```Program Files (x86)\\NUnit(version number)\\bin``` folder.\n\n![NUnit Runner](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/csharp/docs/img/nUnitRunner.png)\n\nOnce you have been able to compile the code it will create a DLL in the ```\\bin\\Debug``` folder of your project. In the NUnit runner, select \"Open Project\" and select the DLL that was created from compiling.

YMMV, please let us know in the issues or [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/exercism/support) if this section\nneeds some love.\n","tests":"\nElisp tests are run using [ERT](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErtTestLibrary), an Emacs Lisp library for regression/unit\ntesting. Tests can be run several ways:\n\n * Interactively and individually, with `M-x ert RET test-name RET`\n * Interactively and all at once, with `M-x ert RET t RET`\n * From the terminal, in batch mode, with `emacs -batch -l ert -l my-test.el -f\nert-run-tests-batch-and-exit`\n * Other options can be found in the docs, `C-h i m ert RET`\n\nInteractive testing is great while you're working on an exercise, but batch mode\ntesting is preferable for when you want to check that an exercise is ready for\nsubmission. The above command is a bit unwieldy, so if you like:\n\n * Create a file on your `$PATH` (probably in `~/bin`) called `ert-run`\n * The contents of the file should be as follows:\n```sh\n   #!/usr/bin/sh\n   emacs -batch -l ert -l $1 -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit\n```\n * Make the file executable with `chmod +x ert-run`\n\nYou should be able to simply call `ert-run exercise-test.el` and run the tests\nin batch mode.\n\n### Working on exercises\nSince Emacs is, itself, an elisp interpreter, your working code is always in its\nnative execution environment. You an evaluate any form by pressing `C-x e` at\nthe end of the form, or a selection with `M-x eval-region` or the whole buffer\nwith `M-x eval-buffer`. This can be extremely useful for quickly debugging your\ncode.\n\n### Suggestions\nSince both your code and tests are valid elisp, it is suggested to work with\nyour exercise code in a buffer pane side-by side with its test, like so:\n\n\nSplit the frame vertically with `C-x 3`, switch to the new window with `C-x o`,\nand open the file with `C-x C-f /path/to/file`.\n","learning":"So you've installed Emacs.

is a strongly-typed, functional language that is part of Microsoft's .NET language stack.\n","installation":"#### Mac\n\nInstall [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/download).\n\nWhile Xamarin is most known for creating iOS and Android applications, it's still a perfect IDE to create F# console\nor library projects which is all that's needed for Exercism.\n\nOnce installed and running, click on new solution and you'll find the library project to select. Don't forget to click the\nlanugage drop down to select F# since it defaults to C#.\n\n![Xamarin New Project](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/fsharp/docs/img/xamarin-fsharp.jpg)\n\n#### Linux\nThe [F# Foundation](http://fsharp.org/) has detailed instructions on different options to install F# on [Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/).\n\n#### In Browser\nYou can also create and share F# scripts in your browser at [Try F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org/Create). Silverlight plugin is required.\n\nCan also try it out at [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) which has the option of letting you bring in [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages.\n\n#### Windows\nInstall [Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop).\n\nInstall the [F# tools for Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41654).\n\nYou can either start by creating your own project for working with the Exercism problems or if you have a **paid version** of Visual Studio you can download a Visual Studio solution that is already set up to work on the problems in as many languages as Visual Studio supports.\n\n![Solution Explorer](/img/setup/visualstudio/SolutionExplorer.png)\n\nThe following instructions are for using the Visual Studio template with a **paid version** of Visual Studio.\n\nBy default, Visual Studio does not allow you to organize F# files by folder. This is a problem because Exercism fetches the exercises to sub-folders. To get around this, install the Visual [F# Power Tools extension](http://fsprojects.github.io/VisualFSharpPowerTools/) which enables folder organization and makes writing F# code much easier in Visual Studio.\n\n1. Download the [Exercism.io Visual Studio Template](https://github.com/rprouse/Exercism.VisualStudio) from GitHub by clicking the Download Zip button on the page.\n2. Unzip the template into your exercises directory, for example `C:\\src\\exercises`\n2. Install the [Exercism CLI](http://help.exercism.io/installing-the-cli.html)\n3. Open a command prompt to your exercise directory\n4. Add your API key to exercism `exercism configure --key=YOUR_API_KEY`\n5. Configure your source directory in exercism `exercism configure --dir=C:\\src\\exercises`\n6. [Fetch your first exercise](http://help.exercism.io/fetching-exercises.html) `exercism fetch fsharp`\n7. Open the Exercism solution in Visual Studio\n8. Expand the Exercism.FSharp project\n9. Right click on the project and select **F# Power Tools | New Folder**. Enter the name for the **existing** exercise folder.\n10. Right click on the folder and select **Add | Existing item...** and select the problem files in the folder.\n11. Get coding...\n\nThe NUnit NuGet package is included in the project, so you will not need to install it.\n\nInstall the [NUnit Visual Studio Test Adapter](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d). This will allow you to run the tests from within Visual Studio. If you have ReSharper installed, you can also [run the tests using ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/unit_testing.html).\n\n![Test Explorer](/img/setup/visualstudio/TestExplorer.png)\n\nYou can also run the tests from the command line by installing [NUnit 2.6.3](http://www.nunit.org/). See the instructions for C#.\n\n","tests":"## Running Tests\n\n### Windows\nAfter installing Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop and the F# tools run Visual Studio and it will display a start screen.\n\nClick on \"New Project\" and you should see an entry for Visual F# and click on \"Class Library\".\n\n![New Project](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/fsharp/docs/img/newProject.png)\n\nInstall [NUnit](http://nunit.org/index.php?p=download) via NuGet package manager with the NUnit.Runners package. This will add the reference to the project.\n\n![NuGet Package Manager](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/fsharp/docs/img/manageNugetPackages.png)\n\n![Installing NUnit](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/fsharp/docs/img/installingNunit.png)\n\nDrag and drop the test file of your chosen exercise into the project in Visual Studio. You can create your own Example file (or drag and drop the one included) and give the exercise a try.\n\nCompile the project (Build -> Build Solution or F7) to generate the DLL file.\n\nIf you installed the NUnit runner through NuGet, the runner will be located in the ```\\packages\\NUnit.Runners(version number)\\tools``` folder where your project is.\n\nIf you installed NUnit manually the runner will be in the ```Program Files (x86)\\NUnit(version number)\\bin``` folder.\n\nOnce you have been able to compile the code it will create a DLL in the ```\\bin\\Debug``` folder of your project. In the NUnit runner, select \"Open Project\" and select the DLL that was created from compiling. This will load all the tests and allow you to run them.\n\nNow you can have fun learning F# and run your code against the tests!\n\n### Mac\nXamarin Studio also ships with NUnit. From the new project dialog, just select an NUnit class library.\n\n![Xamarin NUnit](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/fsharp/docs/img/xamarin-fsharp-nunit.jpg)\n\nFrom here you can write NUnit tests right away.

It's written using a C-style syntax, has statically typed variables, manages memory using garbage collection, and is compiled into stand-alone executables.\n\nGo is noted for the [concurrent programming features](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency) built into the language core, the networking packages in the standard library ([such as a web server](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)), fast compilation and execution speed, and its simple, minimalistic language design.\n\nFans of Go (called *gophers*) describe it as having the expressiveness of dynamic languages like Python or Ruby, with the performance of compiled languages like C or C++.\n\nThe home page for Go is [golang.org](https://golang.org/), and there is an excellent interactive tutorial at [tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org/).\n","installation":"Follow the instructions for your system on the installation page at [golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/install).\n\nExercism supports Go 1.2 and higher.\n","tests":"Go exercises within your exercism project directory can be run by changing to the exercise directory, and running `go test`.\n\n```bash\n$ cd exercism/project/directory/go/leap\n$ go test\n```\n\n### Running benchmarks\n\nMost exercises contain benchmarks, that you can use to determine how changes to your solution affect its performance. To run the benchmarks for an exercise use the command `go test -bench .` inside the exercise directory.\n\n### The `TestVersion` constant\n\nSome exercises require you to define a TestVersion constant in your package.\nThere are sometimes problems where tests change and solutions which worked for\nthe old version no longer work. The TestVersion system makes it obvious when\nthis happens.\n\nTo avoid compilation warnings due to TestVersion not being defined\njust add `const TestVersion = VERSION` (where VERSION should be replaced by the\nvalue of `testVersion` in the test file) to your submission file.\n\nShould the tests change in a way that old submissions will or could no longer\nwork the test writer should increase the `testVersion` value which will cause\nthe tests to fail with a clear message when an old submission is run with them.\n\n## Go fmt\n\nPlease run [`go fmt`](http://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code) on your code before submitting it.\n\n## Hints and tips\n\n### Coding the exercise\n\nThe README.md for each exercise gives a general description but the Go test program will be very specific.  Open the test program and give it a quick look - if it seems like cheating, do it anyway.  Look for helpful comments, test data, and just the names of the test functions.  Try running `go test` before you have written anything and see if the error messages give you an idea of where to start.\n\nYour first goal it to get something to compile, even though it fails tests.  For this, you should \"stub\" functions.  That means leave the body empty, except for whatever it must return.  Write `return 0` or `return \"\"` or whatever just to get it to compile.  Sometimes to figure out function signatures you will have to go back to the test program and read in more detail.  Once you have figured out all the required function signatures, the test program will complain that 0 is the wrong answer.  Now start filling in function bodies.\n\n### Fixing\n\nTests will often stop at the first error.  Fix that one, repeat until no errors.  `go test` has useful options.  `go test -v` will give more verbose output. `go test -run <regexp>` will run just tests with names that match <regexp>.\n\nPanics produce lots of output.  It might seem scary at first, but be brave.  Look at the very top of the panic output for the panic message.  That should give a general description of the problem.  Then read through the rest of it looking for the first reference to your code.  That will often point right to the problem.\n\nTo find problems with concurrent programs, try `go test -race`.\n\n### Cleaning up your code\n\nLet's say that again, run `go fmt`.\n[Golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) can inform you about style issues in your code that `go fmt` won't catch.\nYou might also look at `go vet`, which warns about potential problems in your code.\nRead and heed [frequent comments from code reviews](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments) (aka nitpicking.)\nFor an exercise that involves concurrency, try `go test -race` even if passes its tests.\nKeep readability in mind even if you optimize for benchmark performance.  Sometimes optimization can help you discover solutions that are concise and readable, but there can be a temptation to abandon readability in the pursuit of performance.\n\n### Bonus tests\n\nA few exercises have bonus tests that do not run with just `go test`.  If you are solving the bonus exercise in addition to the regular exercise, you will have to type `go test -tags bonus`, or some similar command as given in the test program documentation.\n","learning":"Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Go for the first time.

Windows users can use Visual Studio, see below.\n\n**Linux users**: [Joyent maintains a document][linstall] that details how to get Node.js installed for a wide range of distributions and package managers.\n\n[linstall]: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager\n\nInstall `jasmine-node`:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install jasmine-node -g\n```\n\nDepending on your setup, you may need super user privileges to install an NPM module globally. This is the case if you've used the official installer linked to above. If NPM gives you an error saying you don't have access, add `sudo` to the command above:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo npm install jasmine-node -g\n````\n\nIf you've used the official installer, your `PATH` should have been automatically configured, but if your shell has trouble locating your globally installed modules&mdash;or if you build Node.js from source&mdash;update your `PATH` to include the `npm` binaries by adding the following to either `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\n$ export PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH\n```\n","tests":"Execute the tests with:\n\n```bash\n$ jasmine-node bob_test.spec.js\n```\n\n## Making Your First Node Module\n\nTo create a module that can be loaded with `var Bob = require('./bob.js');`, put this code in `bob.js`:\n\n```javascript\nvar Bob = function() {};\n\nBob.prototype.hey = function(what) {\n\t//\n\t// Your solution to the exercise goes here\n\t//\n};\n\nmodule.exports = Bob;\n```\n\nYou can find more information about modules in the [node documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports). To make it easier to get started, there's a \"skeleton\" bob.js file in the directory\nfor the first exercise.\n\n## Visual Studio on Windows\n\nInstall [Visual Studio Express 2013 for web](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx). This will include the IDE and web development tools.\n\nTo get started, you can download a Visual Studio solution that is already set up to work with JavaScript and the other languages that Visual Studio supports.\n\n![Solution Explorer](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/javascript/docs/img/SolutionExplorer.png)\n\n1. Download the [Exercism.io Visual Studio Template](https://github.com/rprouse/Exercism.VisualStudio) from GitHub by clicking the Download Zip button on the page.\n2. Unzip the template into your exercises directory, for example `C:\\src\\exercises`\n2. Install the [Exercism CLI](http://help.exercism.io/installing-the-cli.html)\n3. Open a command prompt to your exercise directory \n4. Add your API key to exercism `exercism configure --key=YOUR_API_KEY`\n5. Configure your source directory in exercism `exercism configure --dir=C:\\src\\exercises`\n6. [Fetch your first exercise](http://help.exercism.io/fetching-exercises.html) `exercism fetch javascript`\n7. Open the Exercism solution in Visual Studio\n8. Expand the Exercism.javascript project\n9.

Get coding...\n\n![Add files](http://x.exercism.io/v3/tracks/javascript/docs/img/AddFiles.png)\n\nIf you have a paid version of Visual Studio, you should install the [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com/) extension. It will make working with Javascript much easier.\n\nYou can run the unit tests from a node.js command line using the batch file in the project.\n\n```\nC:\\Src\\exercises\\javascript>test example\\bob_test.spec.js\n.................\n\nFinished in 0.02 seconds\n17 tests, 17 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped\n```\n\nIf you do not see any output from running the tests, you are likely not in a Node.js command prompt.\n\n## Setting Up a Linter\n\nA linter is like a tester for your code's style and formatting. In some languages there are many acceptable styles, and using a linter allows you to be internally consistent (e.g. Ruby), or adhere to one of many common styles. In other languages there are fewer choices, and a linter allows programmers to look at code from a great variety of sources and still feel at home (e.g. Go). You can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)).\n\nThe old standard linter for JavaScript is [JSLint](http://jslint.com). However, it is controversially picky. [JSHint](http://jshint.com) is another popular linter. We suggest using [ESLint](http://eslint.org), which is more customizable than either JSLint or JSHint, and is well-run.\n\nTo get started using ESLint, follow the instructions [here](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html). Once you have ESLint installed, you'll be able to lint your code with a simple ```eslint [options] [file|dir]*``` command. Eg, if you're in the hello-world directory, ```eslint .``` would lint all files in that directory.\n\n","learning":"* [Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming (2nd Ed.)](http://eloquentjavascript.net)\n* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)\n* [Crockford on JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com/)\n* [idiomatic.js: Principles of Writing Consistent, Idiomatic JavaScript](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js)\n","resources":"## Recommended References\n\n* [Mozilla JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)\n"},"problems":[{"slug":"hello-world","name":"Hello World","blurb":"Write a program that greets the user by name, or by saying \"Hello, World!\" if no name is given."},{"slug":"leap","name":"Leap","blurb":"Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year."},{"slug":"hamming","name":"Hamming","blurb":"Write a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands."},{"slug":"rna-transcription","name":"Rna Transcription","blurb":"Write a program that, given a DNA strand, returns its RNA complement (per RNA transcription)."},{"slug":"bob","name":"Bob","blurb":"Bob is a lackadaisical teenager.

make sure you have Erlang installed, following the instructions on the\n[Erlang][1] installation page as appropriate.\n[1]: /languages/erlang\n\n### Homebrew for Mac OS X\n\nUpdate your Homebrew to latest:\n\n```bash\n$ brew update\n```\n\nInstall LFE:\n\n```bash\n$ brew install lfe\n```\n\n### Installing from Source\nWith your system's \"developer tools\" or \"essential build packages\", `git`\nand Erlang's `erl` installed, you can download and build LFE with the following:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/rvirding/lfe\n$ cd lfe\n$ make\n$ make install\n```\n\nOnce you have LFE compiled, you can start up the REPL (interactive session)\nby executing the ``lfe`` binary:\n\n```bash\n$ ./bin/lfe\n```\n\n","tests":"Setup needed (only needs to be done once):\n\n```bash\n$ cd /path/to/exercism/lfe\n$ rebar get-deps compile\n$ export ERL_LIBS=$(find deps -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 | tr '\\n' ':')\n```\n\nIf you're not using Bash, change the last command to what is needed to set an\nenvironment variable in your shell, e.g. for [fish][2]:\n\n```fish\n$ set -xU ERL_LIBS (find deps -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 | tr '\\n' ':')\n```\n\n[2]: http://fishshell.com\n\nFor each example, the following general steps are required.\n\nFirst, compile the module and its tests.\n\n```bash\n$ cd /path/to/exercism/lfe/<exercise>\n```\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir -p ebin\n$ lfec -o ebin src/<module>.lfe test/<module>-tests.lfe\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n$ cd bob\n$ make compile\n```\n\nThen run the tests.\n\n```bash\n$ lfe -pa ebin -noshell -eval \\\n  \"(eunit:test '<module>-tests '(verbose))\" \\\n  -s init stop\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n$ make test\n```\n\nNB The `test` make target depends on `compile`, so to compile\nand test, `make test` is all that's required.\n\n\nHere's a specific example, using the \"bob\" exercise:\n\n```bash\n$ cd bob\n$ mkdir -p ebin\n$ lfec -o ebin src/bob.lfe test/bob-tests.lfe\n$ lfe -pa ebin -noshell -eval \\\n  \"(eunit:test 'bob-tests '(verbose))\" \\\n  -s init stop\n```\n\nOr, using `make`:\n\n```bash\n$ make test\n```\n\nAlthough in the wild, LFE dependencies are conventionally project-local,\nwe've set up symbolic links in each exercise to `../deps`, meaning you only\nhave to call `rebar get-deps compile` once in the lfe track directory\nand the resulting `deps` will be shared across all the exercises.\n\n","learning":"Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for\nthose learning LFE for the first time.

Objective-C derives its object syntax from Smalltalk. All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) is identical to that of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C\n","installation":"Ensure that you have the latest Xcode installed through the Mac App Store.\n","tests":"Exercism will only download a test file. You will need to manually create the header and the source file associated with the exercise. You will need to generate an Xcode Project file with the test file, the header file (.h) and the source file (.m). Alternatively, you can use a test runner utility that's described below.\n\n### Creating the project in Xcode\n\n* Start Xcode and create a new project.\n* Select OS X > Application and then Command Line Tool.\n* Click Next and give it a project name using the ExerciseName is advised.\n* Click Next and save the project in exercism's exercise directory.\n* Now that the project is created click on Editor > Add Target.\n* Select OS X > Test and select OS X Unit Testing Bundle.\n* Name the target ExerciseName Tests.\n* In the left pane (known as the navigator), open the Project navigator and expand the folder ExerciseName Tests and open the file ExerciseName_Tests.m.\n* Replace its contents with the test file you got from exercism.\n* In that file, replace all instances of \"test_suite\" with \"ExerciseName_Tests.\"\n* Navigate to the File Template library in the right pane (or use CTRL+OPTION+CMD+1) and drag the Cocoa Class template into the ExerciseName_Tests folder in the Project navigator.\n* Name it ExerciseName and select ExerciseName Tests as its target.\n* You will now have two new files in your ExerciseName_Tests directory: ExerciseName.h and ExerciseName.m.\n* Click on your project in the Project navigator.\n* Select Build Phases in the editor's navigation.\n* Confirm that both your .m files are in the compile sources list.\n* Use CMD+5 to navigate to the Test navigator.\n* Right click the bundle named ExerciseName Tests and click Enable ExerciseName_Tests.\n* Run the tests by clicking on the right pointing triangle that appears when hovering over the bundle in the Test navigator or use CMD+U.\n\nTests will be run through Xcode.\n\n__Note:__ If you receive the error \"No visible `@interface` for ExerciseName declares the selector ExerciseSelector,\" you followed the steps correctly, but haven't written anything in your header/implementation file(s). After you declare your method in the .h file and define it in the .m file, your tests should raise more helpful errors that will lead you towards completing the exercise. Read this [primer on Objective-C Classes](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-objective-c-classes-objects) for more in-depth information.\n\n### A Test Runner\n\nAn alternative to manually generating the project file is to use a test runner utility, written in ruby, that will create a project file for you with the test file, header file and source file.\n\n```bash\n$ gem install objc\n$ brew install xctool\n```\n\nRun the tests with:\n\n```bash\n$ objc ExerciseName\n```\n\nThe objc utility uses the exercise name to find the test file, `ExerciseNameTest.m`, the header file, `ExerciseName.h` and source file `ExerciseNameTest.m`. The files are inserted into a temporary Xcode Project and then `xctool` is used to run the tests for the project.\n\nWhile `objc` makes it so you never have to launch Xcode to complete these exercises, the error messages and feedback through the command-line are not as clear as through the Xcode user interface.\n","learning":"","resources":""},"problems":[{"slug":"hello-world","name":"Hello World","blurb":"Write a program that greets the user by name, or by saying \"Hello, World!\" if no name is given."},{"slug":"bob","name":"Bob","blurb":"Bob is a lackadaisical teenager.

These resources can help you get started:\n\n* [Documentation for the Standard Library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/index.html)\n* [OCaml at JaneStreet](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/)\n* [Documentation for the Core Library](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core/index.html)\n* [Caml programming guidelines](http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/guidelines.en.html)\n\nOCaml's documentation is spread over multiple projects and can be hard to find because there is what is sometimes called the standard library (the rather minimal library that comes with the compiler) and a Core library (a separate project by Jane Street that aims to provide a more complete and consistent standard library).\n\nConfusingly the standard library is sometimes referred to as the core library (though rarely as the Core library).\n\nThe Core library itself consists of two parts: Core and Core_kernel where Core extends Core_kernel. Often a Core module includes a Core_kernel module, if that's the case the documentation will have a link to the Core_kernel module's documentation page. If you can't find a function it's often hidden in an included module. Note that when you do `open Core.Std` (which is a good idea) you're using the Core library which shadows some of the modules from the standard library.\n\nFor example, instead of [`List`](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html) you get [`Core_kernel`'s `Core_list`](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core_kernel/Core_list.html) (`open Core.Std` makes this available under the name `List`).\n\nThere are some subtle and not so subtle differences between the standard library `List` module and `Core`'s `List`, for example in the standard library `List.for_all` has signature\n\n```ocaml\nval for_all : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool\n```\n\nwhereas in the Core library it has\n\n```ocaml\nval for_all : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool\n```\n\nThe consequence is that to check if all numbers in a list are lower than 10 you have to write the following with the compiler core List module:\n\n```ocaml\nList.for_all (fun x -> x < 10) list\n```\n\nand with the Core List module you need to write:\n\n```ocaml\nList.for_all list (fun x -> x < 10)\n```\n\nor (preferably):\n\n```ocaml\nList.for_all ~f:(fun x -> x < 10) list\n```\n\nA piece of advice: focus on the Core library and ignore the standard library unless you really can't find what you need in Core.\n","resources":"* [Documentation for the Standard Library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/index.html)\n* [OCaml at JaneStreet](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/)\n* [Documentation for the Core Library](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core/index.html)\n* [Caml programming guidelines](http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/guidelines.en.html)\n"},"problems":[{"slug":"bob","name":"Bob","blurb":"Bob is a lackadaisical teenager.

For more details, check out the rustlang book [chapter on crates and modules](http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html)\n\nIf you were starting from scratch you could use `cargo new` to create the filestructure: e.g. `cargo new $projectname`.\nexercism has already created the projectname directory so you'll need to create `src/lib.rs` manually:\n\n```bash\nmkdir src\ntouch src/lib.rs\n```\n\n### Running Tests\n\nTo run the tests, all you need to do is run the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo test\n```\n\nOnly the first test is enabled by default.  After you are ready to pass the next test, remove the ignore flag from the next test (`#[ignore]`).  You can also remove the flag from all the tests at once if you prefer.\n\nYou should try to write as little code possible to get the tests to pass.

If you chose to create an OSX application instead of an iOS application, you will not see a `BobTests` target and will have to create it manually.\n* In the `BobTests` target, open the file named `BobTests.swift` replace the contents with the test file you got from exercism.\n* Add a new file to the `Bob` target folder and name it `Bob.swift`.\n* Select `Bob.swift` and in the File Inspector make sure that both `Bob` and `BobTests` are checked in the Target Membership area.\n* Now use CMD-U to run the tests, and happy coding!\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTest will run through the Xcode GUI using the XCTest framework.\n","learning":"","resources":"### Recommended Learning Resources\n\nInformation about the Swift programming language, including instructional videos, sample code and language manuals can be found at [Apple's Swift Programming Language page](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).\n"},"problems":[{"slug":"hello-world","name":"Hello World","blurb":"Write a program that greets the user by name, or by saying \"Hello, World!\" if no name is given."},{"slug":"leap","name":"Leap","blurb":"Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year."},{"slug":"hamming","name":"Hamming","blurb":"Write a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands."},{"slug":"word-count","name":"Word Count","blurb":"Write a program that given a phrase can count the occurrences of each word in that phrase."},{"slug":"etl","name":"Etl","blurb":"We are going to do the `Transform` step of an Extract-Transform-Load."},{"slug":"anagram","name":"Anagram","blurb":"Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct sublist."},{"slug":"nucleotide-count","name":"Nucleotide Count","blurb":"Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string."},{"slug":"phone-number","name":"Phone Number","blurb":"Write a program that cleans up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages."},{"slug":"grade-school","name":"Grade School","blurb":"Write a small archiving program that stores students' names along with the grade that they are in."},{"slug":"robot-name","name":"Robot Name","blurb":"Write a program that manages robot factory settings."},{"slug":"perfect-numbers","name":"Perfect Numbers","blurb":"The Greek mathematician Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for natural numbers."},{"slug":"allergies","name":"Allergies","blurb":"Write a program that, given a person's allergy score, can tell them whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies."},{"slug":"accumulate","name":"Accumulate","blurb":"Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection."},{"slug":"sum-of-multiples","name":"Sum Of Multiples","blurb":"Write a program that, given a number, can find the sum of all the multiples of particular numbers up to but not including that number."},{"slug":"twelve-days","name":"Twelve Days","blurb":"Write a program that outputs the lyrics to 'The Twelve Days of Christmas'"},{"slug":"space-age","name":"Space Age","blurb":"Write a program that, given an age in seconds, calculates how old someone is in terms of a given planet's solar years."},{"slug":"gigasecond","name":"Gigasecond","blurb":"Write a program that will calculate the date that someone turned or will celebrate their 1 Gs anniversary."},{"slug":"meetup","name":"Meetup","blurb":"Calculate the date of meetups."},{"slug":"triangle","name":"Triangle","blurb":"Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene."},{"slug":"scrabble-score","name":"Scrabble Score","blurb":"Write a program that, given a word, computes the scrabble score for that word."},{"slug":"roman-numerals","name":"Roman Numerals","blurb":"Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: e.g."},{"slug":"binary","name":"Binary","blurb":"Write a program that will convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles"},{"slug":"prime-factors","name":"Prime Factors","blurb":"Compute the prime factors of a given natural number."},{"slug":"raindrops","name":"Raindrops","blurb":"Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's prime factors."},{"slug":"bob","name":"Bob","blurb":"Bob is a lackadaisical teenager.
