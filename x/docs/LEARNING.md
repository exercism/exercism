Exercism provides exercises and feedback but if you don't know the
language it can sometimes be difficult to get started.

We don't have any good resources for learning this from scratch.

Do you have any suggestions? Help us by adding a `LEARNING.md` file to
the `docs/` directory in the [repository on GitHub](REPO).
