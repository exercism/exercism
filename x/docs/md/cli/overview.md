## Overview

Exercism takes place in two places: the discussions happen on the website, and you work on exercises locally. The Command Line Interface (CLI) bridges the gap, allowing you to fetch exercises and submit solutions to the site.

This is a stand-alone binary, which means that you don't need to install any particular language or environment in order to use it.

Choose your operating system: [mac](/cli/mac) | [windows](/cli/windows) | [linux](/cli/linux)
