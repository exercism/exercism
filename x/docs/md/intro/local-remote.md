Exercism is spread across two locations:

1. **Your local computer**:
   Download an exercise, write your solution locally, and submit it to the site. It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
1. **http://exercism.io**:
   Once you've submitted a solution, people can discuss it with you on the site.
   They might ask questions, make suggestions, or simply muse out loud about things that are interesting.

Fetching exercises and submitting solutions is done via the Exercism command-line client.
