##### Help Us Launch!

Launching a track takes a lot of work and we'd love your help!

##### In order to launch we need:

- At least 10 problems
- Add a language icon or logo
- Documentation to cover things like documentation and tests
- At least one person who is willing to check exercism regularly to review new solutions that people submit. This will ensure that the track gets off on the right foot.
- Add track implementors and other designated code reviewers as mentors to the track.
- Toggle `"active"` to `true` in `config.json`


We always welcome help to get a new track up and running.

Check out the [Launch Checklist](REPO/issues/CHECKLIST_ISSUE) to see what still needs to be done.
